            <p>The Parliament of Singapore is largely based from the Westminster system. It is made up of Members of Parliament (MPs) who are elected, as well as Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) who are appointed. Following the 2020 General Election, 93 MPs and two NCMPs were elected to the 14th Parliament.</p>
            <p>Singapore's current Prime Minister (PM) is <span>Lee Hsien Loong</span>. Even as PM, he has his own constituency division to care for and stands for election representing his constituency.</p>

            <p>The Prime Minister of Singapore chooses members of the Cabinet by advising the President. The Cabinet is responsible for all government policies and the day-to-day administration of the affairs of state.</p>

            <p>It comprises the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries of the various ministries. They are <span style="color: #f7524f">Defence, Foreign Affairs</span>, <span style="color: #f8bc2e">Health</span>, <span style="color: #4561cc">Transport</span>, <span style="color: #f8bc2e">Sustainability and the Environment, Social & Family Development, Communications & Information, Culture, Community and Youth, Education</span>, <span style="color: #696969">Trade and Industry, Manpower, Finance</span>, <span style="color: #a71172">Prime Ministers Office</span>, <span style="color: #2b8da5">Law, National Development, Home Affairs</span>.</p>

            <h2>Uniquely Singaporean: Group Representation Constituency (GRC)</h2>
            <p>GRC is a type of electoral division or constituency in Singapore in which teams of candidates, instead of individual candidates, compete to be elected into Parliament as the Members of Parliament (MPs) for the constituency. Each voter of a GRC casts a ballot for a team, and not for individuals. The GRC scheme was brought into existence on 1988.</p>
            <p>The original justification of the scheme was to guarantee a minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that there would always be a multiracial Parliament. At least one of the MPs in a GRC must be a member of the Malay, Indian or another minority community of Singapore. It was also deemed economical for town councils, which manage public housing estates, to handle larger constituencies.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='step' data-step='3'>
          <div class='step-text'>
            <h2>Stagnant racial diversity in Parliament</h2>
            <p>Since the introduction of the GRC scheme, the proportion of minority MPs has not improved. Critics note that the scheme may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit or due to the scheme. One wonders if the slate of candidates at each election would have been more or less diverse without the scheme.</p>
            <p>GRCs can also be used by the PAP as a fail-proof manner for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Every PAP GRC team is helmed by an "anchor" minister, and this may allow new candidates to enter Parliament based on the merits of experienced PAP members. The scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough competent candidates to contest GRCs.</p>

          <div class='step-text'>
            <h2>A one party state?</h2>
            <p>Singapore has never and will unlikely see a rotation of the ruling party like in Western models of democracy such as United States. Opposition parties contesting have long maintained their position of simply providing a check and balance to the People's Action Party, which has won every election since Singapore gained independence from the British in 1959. The Worker's Party won a further 4 seats in the 2020 General Election. The WP's numbers in Parliament are still small and lack the one-third required to break the PAP's parliamentary supermajority, which allows the PAP the ability to amend the Constitution with few obstacles.</p>

          <div class='step-text'>
            <h2>Growing participation of women</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, women in Singapore played a small role in the country's political scene. There were no women in Parliament for 14 years from 1970 to 1984. In recent years, Singapore has seen an increase in female representation in Parliament, but there are only 3 women in the rrent cuCabinet. In 2015, <span>Grace Fu</span> was appointed the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, and <span>Josephine Teo</span> as Minister of Manpower in 2017 and Indranee Rajah as Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office in 2018.</p>

           <h2>Young Parliamentarians alongside veterans</h2>
            <p><span>Heng Swee Keat</span> and <span>Tan See Leng</span> entered Parliament in their 50s, but became ministers in their first term. <span>S. Iswaran</span> and <span>K. Shanmugam</span> are one of the longest serving MPs, with both entering Parliament relatively young. <span>K.Shanmugam</span> entered Parliament when he was just 29 years of age. Amongst the current MPs, only <span>Tin Pei Ling</span>, <span>Raeesah Khan</span> and <span>Nadia Samdin</span>, have become MPs by that age. <span>Desmond Lee</span> can take pride in being Singapore's youngest Minister, a position he achieved when he was 41 years old.</p>
            <h2>Delay of 3G to 4G Leadership transition</h2>
            <p>It appears that PM Lee had initially meant for 2020 to be the year of transition into the 4G leadership. However, when the new Cabinet line-up was announcted after the latest election, the 3G leadership was still in command, with only a reshuffle of the 4G ministers amongst ministries. PM Lee commented that most of the younger ministers came in one or two terms ago, and as such, their exposure in government is not as comprehensive nor as long, compared with the experience of 3G ministers.</p>

            <h2>Beyond party affliation, is there diversity in Parliament?</h2>
            <p>Based on the subset of attributes of each MP discussed so far, with the exception of party affliation and constituency representation, a clustering algorithm is applied to group similar MPs, with each attribute (gender, age, ethnicity, number of terms served and ministry currently serving) having equal weight. Some small clusters can be observed, with no large and tight clusters.</p>
